# Testing Subscription Activation

## Test Direct Activation
When you complete payment and return with a session ID, the system will now:

1. Use your email address to find your account (bypasses cookie issues)
2. Verify the payment with Stripe using the session ID
3. Create a subscription record in the database
4. Activate premium features immediately

## How to Test
1. Sign in with Google using email: chouikimahdi@gmail.com
2. Click "Subscribe Now"
3. Complete payment in Stripe test mode
4. Watch browser console for activation logs
5. Check that subscription card disappears and form inputs enable

The new system is more reliable because it doesn't depend on cookies being maintained across the Stripe redirect.
